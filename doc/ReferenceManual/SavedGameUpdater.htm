          <tr>
            <td>When a game is saved using one version of a VASSAL
module, and then re-opened using a later version, the game pieces
retain the original behavior, even if the piece has changed in the Game
Piece Palette.&nbsp; This is necessary for modules to be
backward-compatible with old saved games.&nbsp; This dialog allows you
to update a game saved with an older version of a module to use the
corresponding piece definitions in the current version.&nbsp; This is
particularly useful to avoid having to recreate Predefined Setups
from scratch.<br>
            <br>
To update a saved game, you must first import the GamePiece information
from the earlier module version.&nbsp; Open the earlier version in the
VASSAL editor, bring up this dialog and export the GamePiece
information to a file.&nbsp; Then close VASSAL, load up the current
module version in the VASSAL editor, and import the GamePiece
information from the older version.&nbsp; <br>
            <br>
You can select any number of
saved game files in the same folder to update at once.&nbsp; The files
will be overwritten, so make backup copies first.<br>
            <p>Under the covers, the updater works by matching each
piece in a saved game to the component in the Game Piece Palette or
Deck that it came from.&nbsp; The piece is then replaced with the piece
defined in the corresponding component in the current version. The Text
Labels, Layer activation, rotation, etc., of the original piece is
preserved as well as possible, but it is generally a good idea to load
the updated games and give them a sanity check before
releasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the component that produced a piece no longer
exists, the piece is
untouched, so the updater won't work well if the Game Piece palette has
been re-arranged significantly. .<br>
