      <div align="left">An At-Start Stack is an ordinary stack of
playing pieces that is initialized at the beginning of every
game.&nbsp; It is appropriate for any fixed pool of counters.&nbsp;
Once the game begins, the pieces are in place just as if they had been
dragged from the Game Piece Palette, except that no more can be created
during the course of the game.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Name:</b>&nbsp; The name is not used during game play.&nbsp;
It is just used for identification in the module editor.<br>
      <br>
      <b>Belongs to board:</b> &nbsp;If a name is selected, the stack
will appear on that particular Board. &nbsp;If a game does not use that
Board, then the stack will not appear. If "&lt;any&gt;" is selected,
then the stack will always appear at the given position, regardless of
the boards in use.<br>
      <br>
      <b>X,Y position:</b> &nbsp;The position in the Map Window of the
center of the deck. &nbsp;If this stack belongs to a Board, the position
is relative to the Board's position in the Map Window.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
      <b>EXAMPLE: </b>&nbsp; A strategic game in which a nationality 
has a fixed force pool of Infantry, Armor, etc. counters can be modeled
by  making a Map Window representing the force pool, with an At-Start
Stack of Infantry counters, an At-Start Stack of Armor counters,
etc.&nbsp; In order to guarantee that the number of each type of
counter is fixed, the Clone and Delete functions of the Infantry  and
Armor counters should be disabled.<br>
