*********************

The following bugs are fixed in 3.2.0-beta1:

* 3486: ConfigureTree.isValidParent() should permit subclasses
* 3472: Initial value of DynamicProperty is not evaluated
* 3465: Empty DynamicProperty causes IllegalStateException on loading

Please report all bugs in beta8, even if they are bugs which you've
already reported against other betas. We take your bug reports very
seriously---they're the reason we've been able to fix so many bugs.


*********************
New Features in 3.2
*********************

* Levels within a Layer can be moved up or down the level list using buttons. 
  [RFE 1604275]
 
* Mass Piece Loader activated by 'Add Multiple Pieces' and 'Add Multiple Cards'
  options in right-click menu in Editor. Specify a folder of images, specify a
  counter template and Vassal will automatically load the images and generate 
  units. [RFE 132985]
   
* Description field added to Toolbar Menu and Multi-Action button components.
  [RFE 2005463]
   
* Specify Keystrokes by name - Key Commands can be entered as single Key
  Strokes as in earlier versions of Vassal, or can be given a 2 or more
  character names. Named Key Strokes are essentially 'invisible' to users.
  Vassal guarantees that a unique real keyStroke will be allocated to each
  uniquely named Keystroke. [RFE 1604269]
 
* Decks can specify by Property Expression which pieces are allowed to be
  Drag 'n Dropped onto them. Piece which may not be added are returned to
  where the drag started. [RFE 1406133]

* Decks can now specify a Hotkey for the Reverse and FaceUp/Down command
  and can customize the Reverse and Re-shuffle menu command names.
  [RFE 2799261]
  
* Counters now support the DeckPosition property. If a piece is not in a
  Deck, 0 is returned. If a piece is in a Deck, then the position of the 
  piece relative to the top of the Deck is returned. The top piece returns
  1, the next piece down returns 2 etc. [RFE 2799291]
    
* Support for mp3 sound files. [RFE 1913850]

* Fix Display/Color handling for Grids and Numberings. Allow Numbering to
  be visible when grid not visible in Zones. [RFE 1637018]

* Implementation of BeanShell allowing Arbitrarily complex Java Expressions to
  be used in Property Match Expressions, In-line Java Expressions and new
  Calculated Property trait . [RFE 1565025] 
  
* Display the Log File Comments in the Chat Window when a log file is opened
  or continued. [RFE 2717634]

* Global Key Commands created on a Map now have an option to affect
  counters on all Maps, not just the Map they are created on. [RFE 2456733]
  
* Traits that move a counter (Send To Location, Return to Deck, Moved Fixed 
  Distance, Pivot) now update the same location Oldxxxxxx properties that
  Drag and Drop movement does. [RFE 2803311]
  
* Added repeat(loop) option to Trigger Action and Multi-action button.
  [RFE 2813702]

* Ensure all commands generated by a single user action are UNDOne by a single
  click of the UNDO action. [RFE 2816016]
  
* Option to allow non-owning players to move Restricted Access pieces.
  [RFE 2828808]

* Add 'Snap to Grid?' option to HexGrid and SquareGrid, defaulting to Yes.
  Allows Grid Snapping to be turned off for the whole grid. [RFE 2842811]

* All scaling is now high-quality. Low-quality scaling (in hardware) caused too   many graphics glitches on Windows.
