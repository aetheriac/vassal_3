Changes since 3.1:

already reported against other betas. We take your bug reports very
seriously---they're the reason we've been able to fix so many bugs.

New Features in 3.2
*********************

* Levels within a Layer can be moved up or down the level list using buttons. 
  [RFE 1604275]
 
* Mass Piece Loader activated by 'Add Multiple Pieces' and 'Add Multiple Cards'
  options in right-click menu in Editor. Specify a folder of images, specify a
  counter template and Vassal will automatically load the images and generate 
  units. [RFE 132985]
   
* Description field added to Toolbar Menu and Multi-Action button components.
  [RFE 2005463]
   
* Specify Keystrokes by name - Key Commands can be entered as single Key
  Strokes as in earlier versions of Vassal, or can be given a 2 or more
  character names. Named Key Strokes are essentially 'invisible' to users.
  Vassal guarantees that a unique real keyStroke will be allocated to each
  uniquely named Keystroke. [RFE 1604269]
 
* Decks can specify by Property Expression which pieces are allowed to be
  Drag 'n Dropped onto them. Piece which may not be added are returned to
  where the drag started. [RFE 1406133]

Help us test
*********************

This is a beta release, and may still contain some rough edges. Should
you find any problems/oddities/bugs, please tell us so that we can fix
them before VASSAL 3.2.0 is released. Also, if you've had problems with
3.1.x or a previous 3.2.0 beta, please check and let us know if those
problems are resolved in 3.2.0-beta1.
