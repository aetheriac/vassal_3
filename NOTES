New Features in 3.1.0
*********************

* Improved installation: For Windows, a real Windows installer/uninstaller.
For Macs, a single-file disk image. Download, click, and install.

* File associations: Files with .vmod, .vsav, and .vlog extensions are
now associated with VASSAL (on Windows and Macs). Double-click a module
to load it in VASSAL!

* New Module Manager frontend: The Module Manager displays all of your
modules and save/log files, giving you a convenient way to organize
them all.

* Improved memory management: VASSAL now uses significantly less memory
for various graphics-related tasks. Heap sizes may be set from within
VASSAL via the Preferences.

* Improved zooming: Zoom your maps to whatever size you want.

module with one click.

* Many, many other minor improvements, and scores of bug fixes.

This is a beta release, and may still contain some rough edges. Should
you find any problems/oddities/bugs, please tell us so that we can fix
them before VASSAL 3.1.0 is released. Also, if you've had problems with
3.0.x or a previous 3.1.0 beta, please check and let us know if those
problems are resolved in 3.1.0-beta5.
